# PlurPoll
_An internal survey tool for plural systems._

Conveniently also a way for me to learn to use python's pattern matching!

On running the program, the input is prompted for a question, then any number of responses. Responses are ended by submitting an empty string.
Voters can vote with "vote [-n $name] <response numbers>". duplicate names will not be rejected.
